Kofta is a pretty broad culinary term. In different countries it refers to a slightly different dish
The common denominator is usually minced meat, mixed with spices/herbs and then shaped in some way.
Here's how to do it Egyptian style!

Our version at home has always involved minced onions, garlic and an abundance of parsley with some well-seasoned minced beef.
It's a seriously simple main meal, kindling memories of family barbecues. That's right - These work equally great on the grill as the frying pan!
A word to the wise, if you're not careful these can burn quickly. 
Your watchful eye, is however rewarded with these deliciously succulent and flavourful jewels.

I often to make a batch on Sunday as lunch-prep for the week ahead. 

## **You will need**
(for about 12 Koftas)

* A whole an onion, peeled and quartered.
* Clove or two of garlic
* A healthy bunch of fresh parsley. 
We're talking a "green-grocer" bunch roughly the same diameter as the circle made by joining your index finger and thumb.
If you're in a supermarket you'll need 2/3 packs
* 1kg of minced meat. This can be beef, pork or lamb, or a mix. 
10-15% fat is ideal for [flava](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVIMAc_U3Tc) and easy cooking. Don't use your leanest mince for this.
* 1 whole nutmeg, freshly grated (I don't rate the pre-ground stuff)
* Salt & freshly ground pepper
* Olive oil
* A large mixing bowl.
* A large frying pan.

## **Method**
* Blitz onion, garlic and parsley in a food processor until finely minced. (20 seconds)
* Add the now minced onion garlic and parsley with the mince in a large bowl
* Add the whole (or most of the) grated nutmeg, with liberal amount of salt, and even more liberal amounts of black pepper
* I personally like to put in a heaped teaspoon of cumin and a level teaspoon of cloves for that unmistakeably middle-eastern touch!

* With both hands (yes, muck in) mix thoroughly until even.
* Take a palm-sized amount of the mince mix and shape into a ball with one hand.
* Once in a ball, shape into a long sausage-like shape
* Run a skewer (or wooden chopstick in my case) through the sausage-shape mix and firmly press/compact around and along the skewer.
Expect the shape will elongate a little. You need to be firm to compact the meat such that it isn't falling off the skewer

![Compact around skewer](/images/recipes/kofta/Kofta_skewer.jpg "compact")

* Remove from skewer, set aside and repeat this process with the rest of the mix.
* Put your frying pan on a medium heat with a glug of olive oil
* Once hot, carefully place your koftas in.
* Gently fry until brown.

As these have a hole in them, they will cook quickly and will dry out if you leave them frying for too long.
I personally find they take 3 turns. The hole means that these koftas tend to take a triangular sort of shape while cooking
* Once done, leave on some paper towels to rest

* Serve with a simple cuscus salad, seasonal greens or in a pitta with hummus and lettuce. 
Or, take to work for lunch ;)

And if you want to go really all out for brunch.. 

* Use sausagemeat instead of mince and a pinch or 3 of flour
* Wrap kofta mix around a soft-boiled egg 
* Deep fry with a semolina-flour crumb

I bring you the *kofta scotch egg*! A brilliant Egyptian twist on a classic

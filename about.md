Currently, I'm a student at King's College London. Would it surprise you to say I'm reading Computer Science?

At the time of writing, I've studying my final year and, like most students, I don't know the meaning of being in a "good financial position". So, I'm working in a department store on a part-time basis to stay out of trouble...
It may not sound glamarous, but flogging suitcases to the public of Kingston-upon-Thames does have its charm.. sometimes..

In the not too distant future, (i.e next year) I'll hopefully be working as a Technology Analyst for an investment bank. How about that for going up in the world?

The website/blog has been an idea for a while... I hope you find at least *some *of it useful or mildly entertaining...

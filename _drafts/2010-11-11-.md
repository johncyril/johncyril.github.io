Two words many of you will be famailiar with if you've ever watched The Mummy or been to an Arabic speaking country...

Or, come to think of it, been to Edgeware Road... Or Bayswater... Or the Marks and Spencer in Kensington. Oh! And I nearly forgot Hounslow's Costa Coffee after 4:45..

Sterotypes aside, you've probably noticed the majorty of these people are the loudest group you've ever heard, are mostly male and sport some kind of facial hair to make up for the lack of it on their heads...

Ok, now for the point of this post. This demographic is one I am very familiar with. But if you have ever heard a middle-eastern person speaking English you will notice (and giggle) at a few things.


1.  B and P are confused at all times. When in doubt, use B


    *   Bolice (police)
    *   Baber (paper)

2.  "TH" is pronounced as s. Even though the TH sound exists in their alphabet!


    *   Erss (earth)
    *   Smiss (smith)

3.  The exception to rule 2 is if the "TH" is at the start of the word. Then it becomes Z


    *   Za (The)
    *   Zere (There)

So to summarise;
"bass za baber blease or za bolice will peat you and I will haff to go W-etch-smiss"

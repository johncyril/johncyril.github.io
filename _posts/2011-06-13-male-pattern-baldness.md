I am twenty-one. A "spring chicken". Supposedly in my "prime" as it were...

Yet for the last 4 years, checking the crown of my head and keeping it covered has been integrated into my daily routine with increasing frustration and failure. I am indeed (and have been) going fairly bald, very quickly. This physical attribute is something normally associated with maturity, stress, responsibility, kids, bills, mortgage.. You get the idea. AGEING.

At 17 I had long hair. Long, black, ringlet![](http://blog.johncyril.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sepia-257x300.jpg "sepia") curls that would spring back into place and almost compelled you to make a "ping" sound as you did it.. It was cool. I was cool. I was in a band with my long, curly hair and despite the fact that I was a crap guitarist, I thought I'd be able to pull off the "slash" look with a top hat and a cigarette. I was deluded. <del>But I was still cool</del>.

Since then, I've gradually cut shorter and shorter.. steadily getting braver every few months... and accepting some irrefutable facts like how it used to take an hour to cut my hair and now it takes 10 minutes, if that. I genuinely feel ripped off at the hairdresser's - we barely made it past exchanging pleasantries last time...

I look older. I've always looked older and I've always been ok with it. I sported a beard as a teenager and looked like a twenty-something. But now I *am* that twenty something, and I look older still. Seriously. I sometimes play a guessing game with new people I meet. The range is 25-38. really, REALLY uncool. I am no longer ok with it.

Worse still is graduation; where my King's College London gown, designed by the mad old hag that is Vivienne Westwood, doesn't have a hat! I repeat. Does **not** have a hat. I mean.. apart from being the international symbol of graduation and everything, the hat is the *one thing* you can use to mask the toll of a 6 month project, 100-page write-up and finals, when you're at one of life's most significant milestones.

Solutions? No cure and I'm not getting some silly "hair transplant" like the nation's new <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13654209" target="_blank">favourite British Bulldog</a>. I have two options:


*   Get a Â£30 for a month, for life subscription for a load of drugs that slow it down
*   Mix urine and potato skins and bathe my head in the solution.
Not that desperate. Not that rich. My mate Fran told me about the latter some weeks ago. Just in case I have a "bad day" and go slightly crazy, I haven't looked it up. I don't want to know.

You know there's something wrong when you're on a bus and get caught checking out some cute girl a little bit older than yourself, only to be met by a "you dirty old pervert" glare...

Hmmm.. Maybe that potato skin thing is worth a shot, after all...

Nevertheless I still have some time to go before my decision will be between letting genetics continue to take its course or doing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard" target="_blank">Jean-Luc Picard</a> of the Starship Enterprise. For now I just have to make do with the nicknames my benevolent friends give me. 'Baldy' over 'Slaphead' any day.

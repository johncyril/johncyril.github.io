What happened to the good old days of Stars in their Eyes? Why must it now linger in the past of those who had the ability to form memories in the 90s? Why is there a spin-off of it every year at a sports arena for a department store's staff Christmas party?

Well basically, Mathew Kelly was accused of touching teenage boys. And something was brewing in ITV after Gareth Gates became cuter than kittens in the eyes of teenage girls. Three words: Simon Philip Cowell. Quite possibly the most unqualified person ever, for what he does on and off screen... Even Cheryl Cole's stunning good looks qualify her for "judging"Â  people despite her monumental ignorance and Geordie accent..

I quite honestly don't care much for the shows and rarely watch them. What pisses me off however, is some genuinely ignorant, brazenly arrogant, dim-witted oaf, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVN4B6d2KB8&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">slurring my country of heritage</a> (3:20). The same dim-witted oaf who's worth millions you may ask? Yes. His only success is managing to make so much money from girls with glitter-tops tucked into their pink trackkies that spend equal amounts of money in the Early Learning Centre and McDonalds as they do buying boy-band singles.

Basically, when I start paying tax, I should just skip the middle-man (HMRC) and make a cheque out to Syco Music.

For the record, in Egypt Wagner would be killed. Instantly - no joke - he would most likely be deemed intolerable by most seeking to redeem the honour of males. And in 1953, the same year Egypt became a republic, Abd-El-Halim Hafez made his debut in the Arabic music world. This man went on to be one of the "big four" great Egyptian/Arabic singers of all time. In fact, he sang at the Royal Albert Hall here in London and died 9 years later at King's College Hospital. When flown back to Cairo, his funeral was one of the biggest gathering of crowds in Egyptian history.

Trivia: Simon Cowell and Wagner are the same age.. Both born in 1956.

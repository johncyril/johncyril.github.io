You may, as a child, have heard the story of  Goldilocks and the three bears. This narrative, first told by Robert  Southey about 200 years ago, has evolved over time into a popular  children's fairy tale. "Mummy bear, daddy bear and baby bear..." and  lil' old Goldilocks.. A far cry from the original 3 bachelor bears and a  curious older woman (spinster), who happened to find herself on the  wrong side of town... Yeah Southey, we all know what *really* happened there... So much for 'trusting, harmless and hospitable'..

Anyway. The story (as I was once told it) goes something like this:


>*Once upon a time there was a little blonde  girl; Golidlocks. Walking in a forest, she finds an empty house. She  enters to find 3 bowls of food. Hungry, she eats from a bowl: "too hot".  The second: "too cold". The third? "Just right"... Goldilocks eats the  entire bowl. After this exhausting bowl of porridge, fatty decides to  sleep. She goes upstairs to find 3 beds. The first: "too hard". The  second:"Too soft". The third:"Just right".. So fatty has a nap and the 3  bears that own the house and happen to be a parent couple with a  toddler bear, come in and find her..*


Then they eat her or something.. I can't remember - the ending to these things normally makes me gag a little..

But other than perhaps being the root cause of why  Jamie Oliver cries so pathetically on television, maybe this little tale  does more to our subconscious than simply making it acceptable to have  atrocious manners or go back to sleep after your breakfast meal...
You know who you are..

It's the search for an in-between of two extremes. And we all yearn for this ever illusive happy medium almost all of the time..

As a computer scientist that sells suitcases, I'm  constantly infuriated by the answer to "what size are you looking for"  that goes something like: *
"ohh you know.. Not too big, not too small"..*
The vagueness doesn't annoy me nearly as much as the assumption that I know *EXACTLY *what they mean..

That said, I had a lecturer in first-year who  taught us programming concepts and made a big fuss about what he called  "the Goldilocks invariant": not too fixed, not too loose. There's  actually a good reason for seeking this kind of strictly vague, static  property within a method, however I don't really wish to bore you..

But we're like this about the amount of spice in  our food, how we describe the weather in spring.. Even the ideal  partner, that we've probably thought about for ages, gets this  description consisting of a negation of two opposing, yet equally  relative values.. What exactly is "not too hot"? What exactly is "not  too nice"?

Point is, it doesn't seem to matter. If we think  something is too much of an extreme we just do a Goldilocks and roll on  the next day/curry/suitcase/poor soul for the same kind of scrutiny,  without much reflection on exactly what we're after. We just know what  we don't want.

Maybe we're just so hell-bent over finding  Goldilocks (through exclusion), we lose sight of what a fat, lazy, picky  old woman she really was...

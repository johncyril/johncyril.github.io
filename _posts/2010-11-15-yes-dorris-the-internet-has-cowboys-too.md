This particular outburst has been due for a while. Thanks to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11754487" target="_blank">today's BBC news report</a> about it however, I see it fitting to finally let loose..

If you are reading this, you are almost certainly on the internet and you have access to a PC. In exactly the same probability, you have also seen at least one advertisement, pop-up, annoying dialogue box or magical notification on your desktop. If you're lucky, it's a blonde bombshell wearing very little, asking you to join her casino or watch her live webcam videos...

After you're quite done pondering this quaint reminder of what you will never have, you will close the popup, click cancel, un-install whatever crap is on your computer or get someone to do it for you.

YOU DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CLICK THE LINK.

Now if you're unlucky, unlucky enough to be utterly stupid that is, you *will* click the link. Not the link for the semi-naked girl... No. If you're clicking that link, you deserve whatever fiery hit your credit card takes. Shame on you. Also, jacking off to one of Mr. A. Photoshop's barely-legal tarts will do nothing for your receding hair line. Trust me.

No. The links I'm talking about now are the ones that offer you and your family safety. The kind of links that mums out there haven't quite evolved the instincts to recognise as bad:


>Oh no.. This pop-up has just told me my computer has a virus and I am at risk. I must install this 100% guaranteed and recommended certified software with the gold badge and thumbs up on it! Everything will get better now..


Wrong. Whatever you just installed is a pile of crap. In fact, you've just rolled out the red carpet for the very thing you were fearing was on your PC. Here's my second piece of advice:

THE GOOD STUFF NEVER ADVERTISES ITSELF.

Not online, anyway. If it's something "Dave" and his mate "Prakesh" at PC World or Dixons are trying to sell you with that Toshiba laptop you're going to regret before Christmas, whatever. I can't tell you everything is bad.

See, you know that "viruses" are bad. And you've sort-of *heard* of "Trojans". And you know they can do anything from just be a pain in the ass to stealing your card details. But guess what? The same lame-ass funnyboys in North America or East Asia know you know! Yes, dimwit -you're being lured under false pretences.

Just in case you missed it the first time:

YOU DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES CLICK THE LINK.

And don't believe any bloody cold-caller too.

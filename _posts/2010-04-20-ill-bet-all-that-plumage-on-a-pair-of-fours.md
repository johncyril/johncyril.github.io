Rather predictably, given half and opportunuty to write about something like a volcano throwing out "clouds" we cant see above us, I will do...

I've spent a few days now, hoping the whole thing would just blow over.. Ok that was awful.
Terrible jokes aside but puns well intended; it has and it hasn't..

I speak of course about the now infamous **Eyjafjallajokull -** does anybody know how to actually pronounce that? All I've heard news  readers say is "Icelandic volcano". Probably wise. Oh and another thing. Iceland!?

I'm going to say this, because I think very few will, even though it's  probably true..

<!--more-->Unless you paid attention to or still do geography, *ICEland* is the least  place you'd expect to find an active volcano.. Some of you will agree and nod in silence, some of you will brand me  eternally stupid.
Well it could be worse. I could have been suprised at  the prospect of Iceland being a country at all, insisting it was merely a  shop selling fish fingers and supported Greenpeace's efforts to "save the whales"...
Anyway. Turns out the whole blinking country is made up of them and that **"Elyja"** (I've renamed it because the other one is just silly) is actually a baby volcano, relative to the others that could potentially start errupting and continue to for years... Great.

To break this down, "volcanic ash" is basically fine rock and glass. Apparently, planes will just spontaneously combust if the ash gets into the engines. Well - that'll do no good to flying conditions...
Most experts have  by now suggested that the density of this crap has reduced to such a harmless  point, that airlines should now be allowed to operate at some kind of level..

To prove it, some carriers have even made test flights; most notably British Airways, with their CEO Willie Walsh.. The plane had 4 crew members on board in addition to himself. I'm personally suprised UNITE weren't caught making plans like a mile high asassination by cabin crew or even praying for a more directed "act of God" at BAWW1..

So what now? Well.. The majority of British, among other european airspace, remains  closed for the 6th day with a review time being continually changed. As per usual, us Brits love nothing more than to get ourselves flustered with a "safety first" approach that has continued to cause disruption to people and the economy.

I think we'll only have ourselves to blame when we tip into recession for a second time this century and see the biggest economic downturn in living memory with the world crippled. Then, an engineering race will start to build the greenest, most efficient ash resistant planes, sparking a 20 year boom in green technology.

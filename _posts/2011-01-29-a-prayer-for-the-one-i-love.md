She is the one I will always love,
Her serenity, her beauty. Her smile in the fading sun.
Her scars bear the hallmark of a painful past.
She has been crushed - oppressed. Stripped through the ages.
Yet still, her heart is good and kind. Her dignity intact,
Healed, in the embrace and clout of time.

I have seen her core. I have kissed her skin.
I am her rock. The tree she watered.
I owe her the blood that keeps me warm,
The bread and salt eaten at her table.
I pray for her a future: Honourable and proud.
She was your refuge in time of need. This, you won't forget.

Hear the tears of a mother's son;
Nurse my Egypt back to health.

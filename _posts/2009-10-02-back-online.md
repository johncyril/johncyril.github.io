We have returned. Many apologies for the last two weeks... Server issues beyond human control I believe...

Having spent most of the night bringing all this back, I have learnt the importance of keeping a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup" target="_blank">BACKUP</a> of the flipping site. Needless to say, I haven't got round to actually doing it...

In other news, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/us/default.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft</a> (namely their <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/" target="_blank">Windows 7</a> team) are the luckiest nerds alive. Had we been online when <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cX4t5-YpHQ" target="_blank">this</a> came out, a bloodbath would have ensued.

Something interesting/scathing to follow soon...

Typical cynical, bad loser fashion. When I am rejected from an opportunity I have spent days applying for and thought I would succeed in, I become childish. I lick my wounds and become a the epitome of sarcasm. Abrasive enough to scratch the sandman himself. I sulk and tell myself that it's their loss. More fool them for not employing the best thing since sliced bread...

Here it is. On paper I look awful. My "poor" A-levels in comparison to the supposed quality of the institution I study at, raise both eyebrows.
"So, do you have any family ties to heads of faculty?..."

I also suck at maths. I hate it with more passion than I love playing my guitar. It's sheer ignorance - I hate it because I don't understand it. And I don't understand it because I don't want to. [Double angle formulae](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_trigonometric_identities#Double-.2C_triple-.2C_and_half-angle_formulae) just remind me of the late nights and early mornings inspired by a <a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/admissions/undergraduate/courses/compsci/index.html" target="_blank">dream</a> I tried so hard to realise, that I lost all levels of pragmatism.

Shock, awe and an envelope full of snot:


>"... In view of the information provided on your application form it is clear, I am afraid, that it would stand effectively no chance of success against the very strong competition for places here..."


That one is on my wall. So I "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UCAS#Clearing" target="_blank">cleared</a>". So I'm not the best thing since sliced bread.
I may not be able to do your 35 sums in 20 minutes or tell you about a time I had to do something I really didn't want to that doesn't include your monotonous, pitiful excuse for an application form.

I have however, only ever failed an interview once. An Orange store, when I didn't walk out in disgust after the manager told me he tells customers to "f*** off" if they annoy him...

I'm smarter and much more impressive than your anal, stereotypical filtering systems and cut-off curves give me credit for.
Try me.

Why will it take making key-note speeches and honorary doctorates for you to finally realise?

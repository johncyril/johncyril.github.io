Ah yes. The hiatus has come to an end. It's been nearly two months since my last entry. For this I apologise most sincerely. My circumstances have been as follows...


*   I have had exams
*   After my exams, all the interesting (mostly political) stuff had finished
*   Nothing has pissed me off and I haven't been feeling particularly sarky
So, on to the title of this post. It stems from my love / hate relationship with football since an early age.
In all fairness, I don't particularly mind the sport... I've never been particularly good, and as the fat kid in school, I was always shoved in goal because of my tendency to make "epic saves"... I realised much later on that this was just simple probability...

<!--more-->Every leap year, lots of countries around the world play it out in a tournament at a chosen country. This year it's South Africa and you're quite frankly an idiot if you haven't heard about anything world cup related yet.

What I can't stand is how the whole nation seems to hold its breath... As if it's nerve-racking. The suspense is actually killing the press (yay!). We have no idea what the outcome will be! Maybe we'll win it this year?

No. We won't. We won 44 years ago. It's been 11 world cups. Get real.

We do not have a fantastic and world class team. We have lots of decent players, a couple of wonderful ones and that's just about it. There isn't any magic. Nada. We are not a team brimming with talent. Testament to this is our premier league. A lot of familiar faces and names seem to be commented on during the games England *isn't* playing in this tournament..

A great team is one that doesn't have the papers kicking and screaming the moment a "star" player is injured. Nor does it need to have its collective wives and partners banned from contact with them. Rumour has it Capello has banned his men from hitting a home run until they're knocked out... What I'd pay to hear him say that in English...

Dreaming aside, the BBC alone has had 545 complaints regarding its coverage. Well, namely the infamous "vuvuzela" that has had me personally wanting to rip my ears off...

It's been around for about 40 years in Mexico and was made popular in Johannesburg by a fan of the Kaizer Chiefs (as in the team, not the rock band). Still, it's alien to most sane and rational people and has only been mass produced since 2001. Clearly a great year for wine in South Africa...

Yesterday, FIFA (the same people who choose where the world cup is held) stated that they will not ban the plastic "instruments" from stadiums, despite many player protests. Great.

At least this way the apprehensive, nail-biting silence of pubs and bars that have banned hooligans can be drowned out by a constant, fly-like humming.

Come on England...

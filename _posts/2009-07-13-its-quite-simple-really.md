So you're back from work or uni/college/school. When flicking on your computer, the first thing you're likely to do is check your e-mails. (or facebook if you're that sad)

After both, MSN messenger &amp; spotify or something to that equivalent is how you'll spend the remainder of your online evening.

A bit of browsing never hurts though... current affairs? stock market? people's tweets? How about your favourite gadget blogs? Or even those from people you know? Tomorrow's weather wouldn't go amiss either...

<!--more-->

You'll find yourself opening various tabs and windows, flicking between them or going to another site altogether simply because you've found nothing particularly interesting...

What if you could collate all those sites, the weather and the news in one place?
It's actually really simple. And because people in the world of IT/computing are so imaginative, you'll be incredibly suprised to hear that a way of doing the aforementioned is called, really simple syndicate ([RSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS)).

You may hear it being called "rich site summary", but RSS is just a rather simple format that summarises information in the form of header &amp; text and links to the source it came from. Think of it as a live feed and a way of collating all those feeds from your favourite sites is by using a feed reader.

One of the most popular is [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?hl=en&amp;nui=1&amp;service=reader&amp;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2Freader%2F), probably because it's rather intuitive and google will take over the world at some point in the near future....

Nevertheless there are alternatives if you wish - just **search** them in... err.. your favourite **search** engine!

If you use [firefox](http://www.mozilla-europe.org/en/firefox/), you can have these feeds placed into your bookmarks at the click of a button. [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) and [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) also have similar functionality...
If you're using Internet Explorer; get firefox!

Every time you see [this logo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Feed-icon.svg), you can subscribe to an RSS feed from that source/site. Naturally, WordPress supports RSS and you can use it to keep up to date with this blog, without having to visit it, to see if I've made any recent posts. If you're using google reader (or would like to), click the button at the end. Otherwise the link to my feed is [here](http://www.johncyril.com/wp-rss.php) and at the top right of the page. (click the logo itself!)

Try it!

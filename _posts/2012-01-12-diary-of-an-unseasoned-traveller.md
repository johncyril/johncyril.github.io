Nothing quite feels like being on a plane at thirty thousand feet and being served British Airways' emmental cheese and smoked ham roll. Not quite the hot breakfast being served in first class a mere four seats away and separated by the most pointless curtains that were humorously torn as they were drawn shortly after takeoff.

It dawns on me that this is the first time I have flown by myself without family or friends.. And indeed my first time abroad alone. I quite like it and provided it's a short flight, I think this is certainly the way to go from now on.

Bank holiday weekend brings what I presume to be the usual nuances of peak season travelling... Babies crying their eyes out, copious amounts of excitednesss by toddlers and the occasional teenager who, behind his floppy hair, looks like he'd much rather have a house party with his mates at home while mum and dad go to sandals..

This is in stark contrast, of course to the bus-like "system" of easyJet. Here, people stampede towards an engineer with a fluorescent vest standing between double doors. Speedy boarding first. His only 2 minutes of authority before he jumps out of the way exclaiming, "you may now board" to the masses. The dog-eat dog race for seats begins...

There is no classical music playing as you manoeuvre your bag into an overhead space. There are no leather seats, no hook for your coat.. Don't even ask about a pair of headphones and over 13 radio stations to choose from.

You will intentionally ignore the 6ft5" gentleman who has spread his belongings onto the last window seat in the first half of the plane. The same twit, coincidentally, that took him upon himself to barge himself 10 people ahead of you. The "mile-high" club is not for those picking fights. Besides he has a face like a swollen anus.

This is my second trip abroad on my own. One of many that I hope will follow. And, though probably I cannot help it, this is most definitely not the way forward. I certainly wish for the day when I can happily afford the JD, coke and peanuts treatment with consistency and nonchalance.

Alas, today is not that day. And as that famous T-shirt worn by busty bimbos goes; tomorrow doesn't look good either...
Nevertheless this, among most things in life Â is simply a means to an end. And what an end it's proving to be..

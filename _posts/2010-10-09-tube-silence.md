>"Hello Simon, I'm on the train at Bond Street..."


I know. An impossible phone conversation. For those of you who don't  use London's "rapid transit" network, allow me to explain: Just  under half the stations are underground, and there is no signal what-so-ever  below the surface. Bond street happens to be one such station.

The  way things are today, should you go through a tunnel, you will hear  nothing but the belligerent squawking of train carriages.. "The Tube",  as we affectionately call it here, is a bizarre place.

Nobody  talks. Even couples sit there holding hands or sitting on laps in  silence, gazing at the people opposite or the station maps stickered  around. Occasionally, a rowdy group of tourists will board for a few  stops between the usual landmarks.

Why? Well, in this city, we're  very weary of strangers. It takes the most incredible circumstances  like a 15 minute delay or a tramp that hasn't washed since Christmas, to  create a 2% chance Â somebody around you will simply raise their  eyebrows in empathetic frustration.

If you're travelling with a friend,  you'll be very wary of a quiet carriage full of people very eager to  listen to your gossip.

Enter "city blonde". Â Hair tied back, pencil skirt, blouse and possibly a distinctively female briefcase-hand-bag-thing with a copy of the financial times. Nobody looks at the map now. The girls are green with envy. They guys? Well.. The middle-aged ones are sweating and Â the younger ones are sitting up straight and big in their seats. Oh and there's always one laid-back twat in his "le coq sportif" tracksuit, NY gangster cap and his hands suspiciously awkward in his pockets..

I mean seriously dude.. Do you even know what the financial times is?

Me? I'm the one without the balls to do anything more than look at the tube map with a vacant, disinterested look faked across my face..

So tube scenario over? No, because for half the time, the tube runs over ground. Phone calls. It's not so quiet outside of the central zones. People are talking. The faint whisper of one-sided chatter reassures your heart that you are indeed among other humans. No terminators here today, JC.

Watch this space. London is currently racing New York to become the first city that installs signal in underground stations. Over time this will extend to tunnels or maybe even the tubes themselves. At the moment, Mayor Boris Johnson wants the telecoms providers to pay the price. We'll see how that works.. Even if Londoners help out, the idea could be so expensive it falls flat on its face.

In the meantime, I'll keep hoping for the ability to text rather than memorise tube stops when a city blonde walks on.

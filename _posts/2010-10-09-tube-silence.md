>"Hello Simon, I'm on the train at Bond Street..."


I know. An impossible phone conversation. For those of you who don't  use London's "rapid transit" network, allow me to explain: Just  under half the stations are underground, and there is no signal what-so-ever  below the surface. Bond street happens to be one such station.

The  way things are today, should you go through a tunnel, you will hear  nothing but the belligerent squawking of train carriages.. "The Tube",  as we affectionately call it here, is a bizarre place.

Nobody  talks. Even couples sit there holding hands or sitting on laps in  silence, gazing at the people opposite or the station maps stickered  around. Occasionally, a rowdy group of tourists will board for a few  stops between the usual landmarks.

Why? Well, in this city, we're  very weary of strangers. It takes the most incredible circumstances  like a 15 minute delay or a tramp that hasn't washed since Christmas, to  create a 2% chanceÂ somebody around you will simply raise their  eyebrows in empathetic frustration.

If you're travelling with a friend,  you'll be very wary of a quiet carriage full of people very eager to  listen to your gossip.

Watch this space. London is currently racing New York to become the first city that installs signal in underground stations. Over time this will extend to tunnels or maybe even the tubes themselves. At the moment, Mayor Boris Johnson wants the telecoms providers to pay the price. We'll see how that works.. Even if Londoners help out, the idea could be so expensive it falls flat on its face.

I only ever met one person in my entire life who hated the word "buzz".. It actually made them heave and their skin crawl.

Hopefully for our beloved and omnibenevolent Google however, this will not be the norm. Well - for now...

Introducing Google Buzz! No choice. It's there. Sitting ostentatiously in your GMail page...
Looks as if the big G failed to buy twitter and said "screw this! - we'll make our own." Fully integrated with Picasa and it'll also automatically "post" your status updates from google chat.

<!--more-->So technically, if you're a Google fan boy (or girl), you have no need for twitter, or twit pic... These neat, in house solutions will do perfectly fine and Buzz will no doubt integrate with the Android and Nexus phones later down the line...

Read between the lines though and you'll see there's a real sense of urgency about the whole thing...


*   No public beta - that's almost a first...
*   I personally missed it on Labs..
*   There's no choice in having it there. All you get is the option to see the explanation or not when it makes itself to your page the first time...
It can be set to feed from twitter. But twitter defined itself. It has, in essence become a verb; "I'm tweeting". Hell will freeze over when the verb "buzzing" makes its way to forums or Absolute radio...

Quite honestly, I get the feeling that buzz it's being shoved down my throat and as a result I'm going to refuse to use it. Simply because I'm a stubborn old mule...

But it is unusual for the company, that's poised to take over the world before the middle of the century, to miss a boat as big as this... And it looks like they really have. The spat in China last month appears to have rattled the cage of business-assessment with the popularity and potential of twitter leaving red, self-inflicted, palm-sized marks on the foreheads and faces of Google big cheeses.

"Why didn't we think of it first?"

As mentioned in [part one](http://blog.johncyril.com/?p=61), hard disks are parts of your computer system that connect to the motherboard and take power from the power supply. Great - but what the hell do they do?

I shall attempt to explain this, by first talking a little about data storage. This is also known as **memory**. Much like us, computers have the ability to store information.
There are several different types of said memory and many ways to categorise them. For the purpose of fulfilling the title of this post, we shall split memory into only **two different types**...

The first is called **temporary**, also known as [RAM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_memory). Think of this as your short term memory... Ever revised and crammed so much information for an exam before? Only to  forget everything you spent weeks trying to retain, the moment you've stepped out of the exam hall? If you don't need the information to hand, over time you'll forget more of it. I for one, have lost the ability to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiation_of_trigonometric_functions" target="blank">differentiate trigonometric functions</a>... Because its useless to me...
Computers behave in the same way. They remember the recent programs you opened, the recent songs you played etc so can do the recent stuff quickest... Try opening photoshop for the first time since you switched your PC on, and again 10 or so minutes later. You'll notice..
The only problem with temporary memory is once you switch off your PC, everything is forgotten...

The second type of memory is **permanent**. Unlike RAM, switching on and off your PC does nothing to the data stored, but its slower for things to be "recalled". CDs and DVDs are an example of such memory, however this is also the kind of **memory in a hard disk**.

You will always have at least one hard disk in your PC. More hard disks, more storage. Your music, photos and documents all live here and without it, you wouldn't be able to do very much with your computer. As technology progresses, the capacity of storage in the hard disk gets bigger. And, they become faster at recalling information.

Currently, most hard disks (or hard drives as they are often called) have moving parts. These parts are quite sensitive and don't do well if they're dropped. Technology is coming out with something called "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_drive" target="blank">Solid State Drives</a>", but as with anything new in the computer world, they're slower and more expensive...

Watch this space though... As usual, a wiki article on hard disks can be found <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_disk_drive" target="blank">here</a>.

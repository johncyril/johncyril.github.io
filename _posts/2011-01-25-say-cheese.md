I think it's about time that I made a shameless plug. During the summer, (that's August for you Australasians out there), I purchased a camera to replace my stolen and much missed cannon point-and-shoot-and-i-take-amazing-photos-no-matter-what thing.. You know the one..

As a person, one of my major traits is my lack of spontaneity when buying something. I research whatever I'm buying to buggery. So much so, that I become a bit of an expert on whatever is currently available (price, pros and cons, etc). Obviously in my line of obsessions that is, technology, this knowledge fades away with time because things always move on.

So I went into Jessops one day for a speculative "feeler" of the camera market. Naturally, I was approached by a very crazy, very talkative, very beautiful girl who just so happened to have a dark, cynical sense of humour; heart-sinking smile; and was in no way, shape or form after some commission. ...I live in hope...

We did the grand tour. All cannon cameras, of course. I expressed gratitude for her time, smiled excessively and left the store before I blurted out eleven random integers that could have quite possibly been my phone number..

She lives in relief..

I took two important lessons away from this encounter. The first went something along the lines of "you useless &lt;insert list of self-deprecating 4 letter words&gt;". The second, sadly, had a much *more* dramatic impact on me: "You can buy a DSLR for the same price as that." Not just a pretty face... A DSLR it would be. I'd wanted one simply for the ability to blur out the background in a photo, nearly as much as I'd wanted to defeat my ignorance of using it.

After 2 weeks of full time work as an office temp and detailed research <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">and as a result of my inability to hold a cannon without going all bleary-eyed</span> I decided to go with a Nikon camera. The most basic DSLR was all I could afford. But still. Happiest day ever. Beaten only by the Christmas that followed, when I was gifted an awesome lens to replace the default one. Which, by the way, produces things like the photo in this post. Since mid-August, I've taken probably over 2000. Mostly shit ones, I'll admit but it's been such a journey.

With no exaggeration, I've never been on a learning curve that's this much fun. And with equally little exaggeration: It's a damn steep learning curve. There are so many settings, so much more to take into consideration and a requirement for really steady hands. Once you get all that stuff right, the results can be genuinely impressive.

Here's the plug: I have a photo-blog that documents the few non-blurry, half-decent, possibly lucky photos I've taken: <a href="http://photos.johncyril.com" target="_blank">http://photos.johncyril.com</a> You can subscribe to the <a href="http://blog.johncyril.com/?p=15" target="_blank">RSS feed </a>or check back every now and then to see how I'm getting along.

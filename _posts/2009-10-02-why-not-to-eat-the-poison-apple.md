![Snow White poison apple](\images\snow-white-poison-apple.jpg "Don't do it Snow!"")

When I was young, Snow White's demise was a red and shiny fruit, delivered by an old woman who lured her into eating it. She ate half and  told Snow  it was the finest of its kind.

As I've grown older, that same fruit lingers in the world. This time, an old man delivers. The apple is white or silver, and yes - he's already taken a bite, insisting it's the finest of its kind. In fact he's been doing so for 25 years...

I speak of course of Apple. Apple mac, Macintosh, mac... Whatever you'd like to call it. The font of innovation for some but the school of brain-washing for others.

I won't really talk about the company's long eventful past. Nor will I talk about its CEO Steve Jobs, who according to my earlier simile is my evil step-father that wants to eat my heart to become the "fairest in the land".... You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Inc." target="blank">read up</a> on this if/when you please...

For readers who know as much about computers/Apple/Snow White, as I do about the workings of the female mind (for another time), a really quick summary:  

>*Apple is mainly a computer and Operating system maker. If you read my previous post about [Ubuntu](http://blog.johncyril.com/?p=9), Mac OS is the one that "some people use". About 8% of computer users in the States to be precise. Both the computer and OS are sold together. They also make and sell the Apple iPod you must have at least seen before... Along with the iPhone you may have glimpsed on a London tube in zone 1 or the subway of Manhattan...*

You could call it designer computing. Apple is pretty much a label. So much so, that you'll struggle to find an "about us" page on their site. What's it about? Where did it all start? Who cares! - look it's shiny and cool. Oh and it's APPLE! There really is a stereotype for the mac end - user. A friend linked me to an amusing <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/28/charlie-brooker-microsoft-mac-windows" target="blank">Guardian article</a> recently, that gives you an idea of this stereotype much better than I ever could...

Apple is not just a fruit. It's a whole eco-system. And it works beautifully, provided you do with it *only* what it is designed for... and you don't bring anything "non-apple" in. The Computer and the software are practically one, the music player works perfectly with the computer (via iTunes) and the phone ices the cake by bringing the likes of music, email and <a href="http://maps.google.com" target="blank">google maps</a> to your pocket.

This is just it. You have what Apple give you. If you don't like the software, tough. If you want a more powerful or cheaper notebook, tough. If you want to be able to take the battery out of the mobile phone, tough. There are no alternatives. Well, there are in some cases.. but they just wont work as well and you'll end up smashing the beautiful synergy of that "eco-system" that 92% of US users don't fancy paying a premium for.

Herein lies the poison. Bite/buy in and enjoy a mostly problem-free computing experience, but crave forever the flexibility of other devices, programs or indeed the latest cool "non-apple" gadgets...

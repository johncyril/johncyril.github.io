The film industry has been racking its brains since the turn of the millennium. Broad-band connections exceeding 512kb have over quite some time become the norm. As a result, the streaming and downloading of video content has become incredibly convenient. You need only to look at a site like YouTube and how slow it'sÂ  become over the last few years, due to the volume of people using their service.

While watching a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErMWX--UJZ4&amp;feature=related" target="_blank">6 year-old play a banjo better than you ever could</a> is terribly amusing, the flip-side of the coin is the downloading of copyright material.
We've all heard and seen the articles, where some unsuspecting teenager has been fined vast sums of money for sharing the latest "choons" on limewire. Yes. Limewire...

<!--more-->The film industry, who similarly to the music industry are seeing the decline of revenue (cinema and DVD sales),Â  has decided to fight back of late. I'm not talking about that stupid "You wouldn't steal a handbag" advert we've all been forced to endure before watching something equally as painful like Confessions Of a Shopaholic.

No. I'm talking about 3D. 3-dimensional cinema...
New technology you may ask? Well yes and no. The concept of 3D film is actually quite old..Â  over 50 years old to be more precise.
Back then they used something called anaglyph images. Essentially 2 images from lenses with different filters that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Stereograph_as_an_educator_-_anaglyph.jpg" target="_blank">overlapped</a>. It was this technique that spawned the red and blue "3d glasses" (to reverse the effect) that most people commonly associate now with 3D.

Since the 1950s and even during that time, the method of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_%28waves%29#Unpolarized_light" target="_blank">polarisation</a> became more common. Today, it's still the most widely used. Polarisation, basically filters light in one direction and in one "plane" of movement. This is why the glasses are used - it's the almost same theory as sunglasses. The difference is, that with 3D each eye sees something different. Well - the same image, but from a different viewing angle.. and that's achieved by making the two lenses filter in opposite orientations. (i.e clockwise and anticlockwise)

The new technology has come in the form of <a href="http://www.reald.com/Content/cinema.aspx" target="_blank">RealD</a>. Some dreamy dudes who've spent ages trying to flog their technology to anybody. What makes Real D different, is that instead of using two projectors, only one is needed. It alternates between each "filter" so quickly that the human eye barely notices. The benefit here is for cinemas only needing to buy and install just the one projector.

So does it work?
Quite honestly, no. 3D is an interesting novelty and the occasional trip to an IMAX theatre is about enough. Also, the loss of realism in RealD is much more than in an IMAX. Both use a special camera with 2 different lenses. It's "filmed in 3D" if you like, from the very start, so I personally can't put my finger on why...

Nevertheless, the film industry couldn't reel people in (ha ha) with big screens and surround sound. Instead, it's latest "bright idea" is to still make a cinema experience better than one you can ever have at home.

Sorry hermits..

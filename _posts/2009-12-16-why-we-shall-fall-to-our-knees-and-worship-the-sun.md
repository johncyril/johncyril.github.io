A strange phenomenon is set to grip the country this week. Well when I say strange of course, I mean the rest of the world deals with it perfectly fine. We just like to get ourselves flustered...

If you're eight, unemployed or just plain strange, you'll love the fact that it's set to snow.. actually scrap that.. ITS SNOWING!!111 OMG! ROFL

*prances outside like a fairy*<!--more-->

No, seriously. Take your mind to the carnage that was last year. I can only speak for London when I say this, but we were crippled. Our beloved bendy busses were jack-knifing (thanks Ken..). Trains stopped running because the "tolerance" on the tracks made it impossible and even that oh-soo-trustworthy London orbital, our M25 was backed up about a dozen times around itself...

Ah! there's always the neighbourhood snow fight too; when some twat-ass next door who you don't even speak to, decides to shove snow down your back. And all you can do for the rest of the day is walk - no, waddle to your local supermarket only to find it closed because the majority of staff there only own flip-flips, dolly shoes or converse and the others don't want to ruin their "sick" timberlands...

At least the rest of the world will have a few giggles.

A similar article this time would be the perfect backdrop for the on-going Copenhagen conference about... Guess. **Global warming**.

My favourite memory is on the Piccadilly line days later with a Canadian couple talking about the lack of snow tyres in the country. Freeze frame. Londoner sat beside, in his tweed, elbow-patched blazer and a copy of The Daily Telegraph.

"snow tyres??! -what the devil??"

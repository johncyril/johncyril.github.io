No, I'm not talking about the film. But on a tangent it's a wonderful tale, brilliantly directed and Scarlett Johansson is quite possibly the most beautiful woman ever seen through a camera lens.. The end however, is one of the most frustrating, frequently re-winded few seconds of my life..

Actually, I guess I was lying - the film has a <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03E6DD103AF932A1575AC0A9659C8B63" target="_blank">pretty damn good example</a> of loose interpretation - right at the start... English and Japanese are two entirely different languages, particularly in their formality and succinctness.

I grew up with two languages at home. With that, came two cultures, two senses of humour and two very different ways of expressing yourself... If you're an old subscriber to this blog, you may remember a post I made over a year ago called <a href="http://blog.johncyril.com/?p=18" target="_blank">Heritage</a>. It's quite a skill to translate a joke between two languages and make them funny, but a lot of the time it's impossible. Try starting a joke in Arabic off with:


>Two blondes and a brunette walk into a bar...


The same goes for expressions too! I still have trouble with a lot of English figures of speech - just wasn't exposed to enough of them as a child. There are of course some standard similar expressions such as:


>Those in glass houses shouldn't cast stones.


However my favourite illustration of these differences is with the English saying:


>Once bitten, twice shy.


Which has a beautiful (and rather less succinct) version in Arabic:


>He who is burnt by hot soup, will blow in yoghurt to make it cooler.


My English speaking friends struggle to "get it" but objectively,  I think the literal translation is much clearer than its interpreted one. This is quite the anomaly...

Arabic proverbs are very much like the above. Metaphoric, one-line fables, drawing on the wisdom of experience. English proverbs on the other hand, (England's English) tends to cut right to the chase and are *perhaps* in my jaded opinion much, much clearer..

Another Arabic example:


>A monkey in his mother's eyes is a fawn.


And perhaps the strangest one I know:


>Only the skilled worker can weave with a donkey's leg.


You're thinking "what??!" right? The closest English one I know to that is:


>A poor workman always blames his tools.


Though they essentially mean the same thing, you can see what a bloody nightmare it is to get the message across sometimes.. You have to know both languages, cultures, references... Lead a bilingual life if you will. There are very few people who have this skill - I'll freely admit that I don't.. Not really.. Although I speak both fluently, I'm not culturally immersed enough in either.

You can imagine how easy it is to get the wrong end of the stick and howÂ  the literal interpretation of language, without cultural or even generational adaptation, is the cause of so many skewed views in today's global world.

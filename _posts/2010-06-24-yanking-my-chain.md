I drive. I love to drive. In fact, I love driving just about more than I love doing anything else with my time. It brings this childish, excitable version of my single-digit old self back to life. Thing is, I've never been able to explain why.. control? sense of power? freedom? my desperate desire to drive since I was old enough to comprehend shifting gears in a manual?
All these, in addition to my worship of formula one, have probably played their part. I should point out now that I don't particularly fancy myself as a racing driver.. Well maybe sometimes in the wee hours of the morning...

<!--more-->Nevertheless, being a "racer" in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_Seicento" target="_blank">Fiat Seicento</a> S with a 1.1 engine and about the same BHP as Victoria Beckham's weight in kilograms isn't exactly fast. More.. lots of noise and too much time for people to look at you and think "prick" before you actually get anywhere. If you think of a lion on a rolling, wooden plank with the Blue Peter turtle pulling it (is that thing even dead yet?) - you're on the right lines...

Now. As a motorist, I detest nothing more than some idiot on a bike in the middle of the road where I can't overtake them. Those of you who drive, are nodding in agreement. To those of you who think less of me I would like to say this; The only reason you have not been hit by a car is simply because we are too scared to do so.
Two reasons:

*   You will always win in court (and end up suing our much more comfortable asses)
*   There is a serious risk of you dying (where your families will end up suing our asses).  

Aggravation aside, it's just plain dangerous. Cycling up a narrow hill with a 20 degree gradient and one lane is asking for trouble... Needless to say I yelled my lungs off at PC Plod for doing just that on my way to work last week.. Yes, that's right.. Even the metropolitan police in their infinite wisdom cannot ride their uniform bikes on a cycle lane or dismount and use the pavement when it's too unsafe.

My grandfather died blind in one eye and with an awkwardly healed collar-bone.. simply because he refused to give up cycling on the busy, crazy "roads" of downtown Cairo.. Not to mention the back problems that had him bed-ridden for months, multiple detached retinas and a very long bout of retrograde amnesia.

Then again, London and Cairo are very different places... There, taxi drivers are for the most part wild, insane animals who know no rules. They also swamp the city's centre. Traffic lights are treated with a general disregard and God help you if you're a pedestrian...

Maybe not so different then...

But this will change thanks to London mayor BoJo. He's been begging <a href="http://road.cc/content/news/17967-london-cycle-hire-scheme-becomes-barclays-cycle-hire-scheme-%C2%A325m-deal" target="_blank">Barlays bank</a> for some cash for the new cycle hire... Where all you cyclists can ride your bikes on blue parts of the road known as a "cycle superhighway". How nice. All that money just to repaint and rename cycle lanes... Which most people don't pay attention to....

Helmets and shin-guards are all good, but actually *using* what you're trying to protect will keep you so much better off... Keep your two wheels and balance for designated areas where you'll have lots of room between you and a car, go live in cambridge or just drive your bike to the bloody park.

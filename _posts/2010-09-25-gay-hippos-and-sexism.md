Men can't multitask, women can't read maps. Such is stereotypical 1960s thinking.


>"Yes honey-pumpkin. I'll drive the car and you can cook, hoover and shut the kids up.."


Even now, I get strange looks from girls on the tube watching me text and drink coffee.. Or my own mother's disgust as I watch TV and iron my shirt.. Needless to say, the girls are holding the tube map upside down and mum can't handle the Tom-Tom we got her for Christmas. That now lives in my car... (Best accidental gift ever!)

There are reasons for all this. Genuine biological ones.. Leading neuro-theory suggests that the **hippocampus** works differently in ladies and gents. It looks like a shrimp ([or seahorse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hippocampus_and_seahorse_cropped.JPG)) and straddles both the right and left sides of the brain..

It isn't responsible for multi-tasking, but apparently it plays a very big role in spatial memory, navigation and short term memory. Yes. Map-reading, learning routes, finding shortcuts... In fact, 10 years ago, a UCL study showed that taxi drivers had a bigger right hippocampus,(needed for such skills) than meagre patient mortals.. Whether this was natural or a result of their day to day life is unclear. But the majority of taxi-drivers? Men.

Now. Here's the real kick - According to <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19926651.600-brains-apart-the-real-difference-between-the-sexes.html" target="_blank">other studies</a>, women have a proportionately larger hippocampus than men. Which in my experience makes sense. Girls always remember things I've said (and forgotten) and use it against me..

In other words ladies; you'd be much better drivers than us guys if you took a leaf out of our book and didn't cling to every single word said to you.. Use that hippocampus of yours for bay parking!

Oh.. and you'd make kick-ass taxi drivers...

So, what's my bloody point?

Once upon a time, an Australian insurance salesman decided to write a book with his wife: "Why men don't listen and women can't read maps."

Allan and Barbara Pease used bullshit and small biological differences to gain critical world-wide acclaim... And I mean bullshit. If you can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Pease" target="_blank">be bothered, read the synopsis</a>. By the way. If you agree - go bury your head in the sand.. And please. K*e*ep it there.

There are no differences that explain stereotypes. No Darwinian theories, no biological ones and certainly no theological ones. Girls are just hissy and hormonal... and go all cutesy and suddenly want a baby when a pram goes past them... No common sense reasons why. It's just a fact...

**buries head in the sand**

Oh and No.. Hippos are not gay, but there's nothing like a startling title to capture one's attention is there?

"Ooooboontwo"
Say it out loud...

Following on from my previous post, I think I should talk about this little operating system.

<!--more-->

In the world of all things "computery", there are three main operating system (OS) types..


*   Windows      (the one most people use)
*   Mac (the      one some people use - also synonymous with the apple mac machines)
*   Linux (the      one few people use)
This evening, I shall discuss the world of the third OS; Linux...

Linux has many variations and "flavours"... the reason being is that it is completely and utterly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source" target="_blank">open source</a>.
In a nutshell, it means the code that runs behind the OS is free to obtain and free to edit/chop/change...

Many hardcore coders group together to create variants. One of these variants is called <a href="http://www.debian.org/" target="_blank">debian</a>, from which Ubuntu was born. Ubuntu is probably the most popular Linux OS for the average user, mainly because of its simplicity and accessibility. Most linux newbies (myself included) love having a more GUI based OS as opposed to the much more traditional command line OSs that Linux historically favours...

No need for licence fees or trying to nab an illegal copy off your friend.. *sarcastic, scathing glare*..
In fact, some time ago. it proved so popular and commercially usable enough that even <a href="http://www.dell.com/content/topics/segtopic.aspx/ubuntu?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;cs=19" target="_blank">Dell </a>decided to offer it on some of their ranges as a way of reducing cost for the end user....

Needless to say, they still do now.

Not too shabby...

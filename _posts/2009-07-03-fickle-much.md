Humanity just doesn't know what to focus on...
One could say we are almost spoilt for choice...

Car stereos, radio stations and department stores are buzzing with the corny but ever so suave "pitch-shifts" of the apparently deceased Mr. Jackson's greatest hits,
The world is said to be gripped by a financial crisis that's set to doom all of us into paying for an egg with a wheel-barrow of Â£20 notes,
And if you can keep your sanity, hearing and finances in good order; you'll probably catch your death with "swine-flu"...

It goes without saying that should you get bored of the above, there's always global warming and your carbon footprint to take into serious consideration...

I speak of course over the hysteria, confusion and mass ignorance vis-Ã -vis current pressing issues of our time... Easily blamed on the media.. by the ignorant. Read more! and mix it up.

"if I ruled the world....
I'd probably sell all my crap for mad sums of money, pay off my debts and fake my own death so that I could retire to a private island and sip pinna-colatas in peace..."

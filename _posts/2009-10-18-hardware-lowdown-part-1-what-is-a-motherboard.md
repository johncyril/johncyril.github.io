Welcome to the hardware lowdown. A short series of posts aimed at grounding non-geeks with respect to the inner workings of that magic box in their office, bedroom or study.
This isn't an in-depth guide to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Componentes.JPG" target="blank">electronic components</a>, but merely an introduction to the PC basics. Just so you'll be able to wangle an "I'm impressed" smile out of your local techie in casual conversation...

We start with the **Motherboard** (mobo if you want to get with the geek lingo.. NB: not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Black_Origin_Awards" target="blank">MOBO</a>) . It's basically a mother****** of a circuit board, meaning it's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printed_circuit_board" target="blank">several printed cuircuit board</a>s layered on top of each other.

This is the **root and core** of all computers. Without it, your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">monitor</span>, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">mouse</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">keyboard</span> wouldn't be able to "talk to each other". I'd like to stress that it doesn't do the "talking", but merely **provides lines of communication** for such talking to happen. These lines are called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_%28computing%29" target="blank">Data Buses</a>, which is beyond the intended scope of this post, but worth a read if you've discovered your calling in computing...

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSU-gold-full_set.jpg" target="blank">![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/PSU-gold-full_set.jpg "Power supply (taken from wiki)")</a>

Along with the underlined above,  the motherboard will also connect to your <span style="text-decoration: underline;">hard disk</span> (explained in a later post). Anything that you "plug in" to your computer externally (i.e USB) makes a direct connection to the board and will most likely draw power from it too. This power comes from a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PSU-gold-full_set.jpg" target="blank">power supply</a> (surprise, surprise). The long connector on the bottom right is what goes into the motherboard itself. The other connectors are for CD/DVD ROM drives and hard disks which I mentioned earlier.
If you ever take a look at the back of your computer, you'll notice some holes for ventilation. That's where the power supply is, and nearby is a cable that plugs into your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:G_plug.png" target="blank">wall socket</a>.

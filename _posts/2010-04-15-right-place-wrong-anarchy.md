Those of you in the UK, or more specifically London, may recognise Brixton as an area best avoided. If you haven't yet had the pleasure of visiting the British Isles, think of what Harlem is to New York (<span style="text-decoration: line-through;">minus guns</span>) and you're on the right track..

But aside from being mugged, beaten or crapping yourself as you walk through their cottage chicken infested high-street, you may be surprised to learn that Brixton's people has a different kind of breed...

<!--more-->Meet BLAG - le <a href="http://www.blagblagblag.org/" target="_blank">Brixton Linux Action Group</a>. I know. Linux action group? I mean - what the...

If you're unsure what I mean by Linux; it's an operating system. A free one that comes in all kinds of different flavours. Look up my post titled "Ubuntu" in the search bar above my twitter feed...

Anyway. Linux evangelists? Normally, in the geek world, you'd expect this kind of fanaticism from die-hard Mac users... Don't get me wrong. Fan clubs, groups and societies exist that love and promote Linux. Traditionally though, they're mainly passive, jolly nerds playing and making "cool" free software...

BLAG is different.. Their "mission statement" on their homepage reads like a definition:


>"works to overthrow corporate control of information and technology through community action and spreading Free Software."


Geeks getting aggressive? Only in Brixton...

Wondering around their website, you'll find various interesting things. For example, they have their own flavour of Linux that they promote and use (BLAG 90000) and also a paper titled "<a href="http://www.blagblagblag.org/anarchism/index.html#note7" target="_blank">Anarchism Triumphant</a>"Â  (which is actually an ok read if you care/have the time).
For some reason they can't spell or consider it a slur to have the word "windows" written correctly too...

Take a look at the forums and you'll realise they're not just hot air - they're actually genuine and active crusaders.. They have an IRC channel (think lame chat room) and even regular weekly meetings...


>"Bring your boxes, laptops and ethernet cables to 365 Brixton Road. London. Install and configure GNU/BLAG Linux with help from some friendly geeks. Dual booting? No problem? Having some trouble with wireless cards? We'll look into it."


It's difficult to say how strong the following is. But it's even stretched as far as <a href="http://forums.blagblagblag.org/viewtopic.php?t=5055" target="_self">Austria</a>!Â   It just goes to show that even in the most unlikely of places, what you least expect to find actually exists.

I suppose using that logic, a Tory leader capable and worthy of running the country may just emerge one day..

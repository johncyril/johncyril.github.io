So I've been away for a good month. In Egypt, Cairo mainly, and the done thing is to take a few days out during the summer and hit one of the beautiful coasts in the country. It was my job to do some research to find us a nice hotel to stay in...

<!--more-->

A quick search brought up the Grand  Plaza hotels of Sharm-el-sheik and Hurghada. Luxury 5 star resorts. Lovely. Well, until you call them up that is....

An Arabic enquiry returned the title of this little post. Basically, the hotel manager (who is an Egyptian) refuses to book in other Egyptians! Speak to the sales rep in English and inform him you have a British passport - wow! You're more than welcome! But... the rest of your Egyptian family isn't....

The theory goes like this:

Most Egyptians apparently "have no shame". They will expect and use/eat/steal too much at a luxury resort in their own country....

Many other big shot resorts will charge native Egyptians more then foreign tourists using the same wrong and unjustified "reasoning"!

A polite reminder to all those resorts and hotels. Difficult and undesirable customers come from all over the world...
When tourism and foreign bookings slump, remember who your bread and butter is; you selfish, discriminating buffoons.

Racism at its finest and most ironic.

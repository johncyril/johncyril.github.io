In the run-up to the festive season, retail outlets across the western world are inundated with people, purchases and snotty kids searching for Santa.. Christmas is, of course, the time of year when people give each other items of novelty or comic value for a very good reason:
"It's what everyone else does"

This is not a rendition of the "real meaning behind Christmukkah".. If that's what you want, watch the Muppet's Christmas carol, Dr. Who on Christmas day or The OC holiday special of season 1..

Due to what one friend calls; "the primary gifting season", you would be wise to avoid all kinds of shops, all hours of the day, every single day until the new year... The week after the 25th you may ask? Sale, my dear. Yes. This one is a festival for all people of all creeds - red banners and slashed prices and face-palming if you bought it at full-price a week ago..

This advice is not given lightly or in jest. I work in retail.. A department store in south-west London.. This will be my third winter (and hopefully my last) smiling enthusiastically at customers with baskets full of several dozen bits of crap with no barcode... I call them customers - They're more like drones or bothered zombies - inconvenienced by the obligation to purchase things for other people that: they work with and can't stand or worse still; have bought things for their kids.

And even though I'm doing them a favour in my unpaid presence after the store has closed, many of these soulless, conceited buggers deem it suitable to huff and tut, venting their pointless existence for the last 4 hours in the form of complaints and atrocious manners...

A personal favourite is a lady who considered herself a savant of retail law. We had what I'll call a "till-point pop-quiz"... Needless to say I won. aka:


>"I don't like your attitude. Don't get shirty with me - I want your manager."


I obeyed. Sudden death. Manager wins. Hell hath no fury. The savant (now turned flamethrower) points to me:


>"You are: Ignorant... uneducated... dead-end job, doing this for years and probably the next 30.. have nothing to live for, no prospects..."


I'm sure it went on, but I learnt something that day... I can't listen when I laugh. Honest..

And *oh* how I laughed.

A very happy Christmas to you all and don't forget to wish that unfortunate bastard at the till too.
